##  CRISPR
CRISPR is a gene found in bacteria that contains a piece of the genome of a virus that once attacked the bacteria.Bacteria use these genetic fragments to detect and fight off attacks by the same viruses and destroy their DNA.Such genomes are key components of bacterial immune systems.Through these genomes, humans can accurately and efficiently edit some of the genes in living organisms, known as the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology.

## The CRISPR/Cas system
An acquired immune system found in most bacteria and most archaea to destroy foreign plasmids or bacteriophages and leave foreign gene fragments in the genome as a "memory".The full name is Constant Palindromic Repeat Cluster/Constant Palindromic Repeat Cluster Associated Protein System,


## Plant Crispr
The CRISPR database for plants currently provides articles about plants generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and we can use information about plants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology to study economically important traits.Users can select the species they are interested in, and then search for keywords to get articles about CRISPR in plants.
